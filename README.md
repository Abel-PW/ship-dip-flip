# Ship-Dip-Flip 
This was the first game I ever made using the Phaser framework. You play as a spaceship, and the goal is to collect as many stars as possible before the comet hits the sun. Meanwhile, you also have to try to avoid the hot fire that the sun shoots out! I created all the assets for the game (except the background) myself.
